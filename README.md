# AdventOfCode2022

For the year of 2022, I have decided to join the **#AdventOfCode** challenge. The goal is to write a program based on a puzzle every day for the month of December. Each day gives two stars - one star for the initial puzzle and a second star for a puzzle that builds upon the initial puzzle.

My personal goal is to try and program almost every day so I can develop my skills. I started a few days late so I don't mind not completing the challenge *right* on time, especially with holidays coming up, but I would like to still be consistent with my coding.

## Goals:

### Readibility

I want to focus on code that is understandable and readible. While I *could* try to write one liners that solve the daily puzzles, I don't see how that will help me in the long run. Code that is both short and understandable is my main focus. After I'm done with the full month, I will go back to my original code and comment it, to see if it is still understandable and readible a month later.

### Maintainability

Aided by the star 2 section of the daily puzzles, I want to try and build code that can later be built upon. For this, I will try and avoid changing code written for the first star while also considering how the initial code could be built upon if this were part of a larger system.

### Speed

Whenever possible, I want to strive for low time complexity of the algorithms used. Ideally, nothing should go over O(n^2), though a lower time complexity would still be preferred and it does depend on future problems. I will analyse every solution later to prove how much time every function takes and to see if anything can be made faster. A low time complexity shouldn't harm readability, so a readible solution will be prioritised over a fast solution. Space complexity won't be taken into consideration as much.
