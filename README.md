# AdventOfCode2022

For the year of 2022, I have decided to join the **#AdventOfCode** challenge. The goal is to write a program based on a puzzle every day for the month of December. Each day gives two stars - one star for the initial puzzle and a second star for a puzzle that builds upon the initial puzzle.

My personal goal is to try and program almost every day so I can develop my skills. I started a few days late so I don't mind not completing the challenge *right* on time, especially with holidays coming up, but I would like to still be consistent with my coding.

## Goals:

### Readibility

I want to focus on code that is understandable and readible. While I *could* try to write one liners that solve the daily puzzles, I don't see how that will help me in the long run. Code that is both short and understandable is my main focus.

### TBA
